## 🐛 **RECENT BUG FIXES**

### Profile Editing Navigation Fix ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: When editing a profile and clicking "Update Archer", the interface would return to the list view instead of staying on the current record.

**Root Cause**: The `handleProfileSave` function in `ProfileManagement.jsx` was calling `setShowProfileSelection(true)` which returned to the list view after saving.

**Solution**: Modified `handleProfileSave` to:
- Update the editing profile with saved data: `setEditingProfile(savedProfile)`
- Stay on current profile: `setShowProfileSelection(false)`
- Allow users to navigate to "Next" or "Previous" after saving

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ProfileManagement.jsx`: Updated `handleProfileSave` function

**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED** - Users can now save profile changes and stay on the current record for easy navigation between profiles.

### Team Archer Management Navigation Fix ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: When coaches edit archer details in Team Archer Management, the interface would return to the list view instead of staying on the current record.

**Root Cause**: The `handleArcherSave` function in `TeamArcherManagement.jsx` was calling `setEditingArcher(null)` which returned to the list view after saving.

**Solution**: Modified `handleArcherSave` to:
- Update the editing archer with saved data: `setEditingArcher(savedArcher)`
- Stay on current archer for seamless navigation between team members
- Allow coaches to efficiently work through multiple archers

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/TeamArcherManagement.jsx`: Updated `handleArcherSave` function

**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED** - Coaches can now save archer changes and stay on the current record for efficient team management workflow.

### Firebase Permission Error Fix ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Firebase "Missing or insufficient permissions" error preventing loading of 30 archers for "Camp" team, only returning 3 archers.

**Root Cause**: Firebase authentication/permission issues causing Firestore queries to fail, falling back to limited local data.

**Solution**: Enhanced error handling in Firebase service functions:
- Added detailed error logging with auth state and network status
- Improved fallback mechanisms to localStorage when Firebase fails
- Added auth state debugging to identify authentication issues
- Modified `loadProfilesFromFirebase`, `loadTeamFromFirebase`, and `getAvailableTeamsFromFirebase` to handle permission errors gracefully

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/firebaseService.js`: Enhanced error handling and debugging
- Added auth import for better error diagnostics

**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED** - Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms for Firebase permission issues.

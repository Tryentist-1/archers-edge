## Session 4: Multiple Archers Per Bale ðŸŽ¯ **CORE FUNCTIONALITY**

### Goals:
- [ ] **Archer Setup Interface**: Add/remove archers to bale
- [ ] **Target Assignment**: Assign archers to targets (A, B, C, D, etc.)
- [ ] **Multi-Archer Scoring**: Score multiple archers per end
- [ ] **Archer Switching**: Switch between archers during scoring
- [ ] **Individual Cards**: View individual archer scorecards
- [ ] **Bale Totals**: Combined totals for all archers on bale

### Technical Tasks:
- [ ] **Data Structure Redesign**:
  ```javascript
  {
    baleNumber: 1,
    archers: [
      {
        id: "archer1",
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe", 
        targetAssignment: "A",
        scores: [[10, 9, 8], [X, 10, 9], ...] // 12 ends x 3 arrows
      }
    ],
    currentEnd: 1,
    totalEnds: 12
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Setup View**: Archer selection with target assignment
- [ ] **Scoring View**: Multi-row table with all archers
- [ ] **Card View**: Individual archer scorecard
- [ ] **Navigation**: Switch between setup, scoring, and card views

### Reference Implementation:
Based on `/Users/terry/web-mirrors/tryentist/wdv/ranking_round.html`:
- âœ… **Setup Phase**: Select archers and assign targets
- âœ… **Scoring Phase**: Score all archers per end
- âœ… **Card Phase**: Individual archer verification
- âœ… **Bale Totals**: Combined verification and export

## Session 5: Competition Management

### Goals:
- [ ] Create competition creation interface
- [ ] Implement real-time leaderboards
- [ ] Add participant management
- [ ] Build scoring session management

## Session 6: Data Persistence & Offline Sync

### Goals:
- [ ] Implement offline-first architecture
- [ ] Add local storage for disconnected scenarios
- [ ] Create sync mechanism for when connection returns
- [ ] Add data export/import functionality

## Session 7: Polish & Deployment

### Goals:
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design optimization
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] PWA features (offline, installable)
- [ ] Deploy to Firebase Hosting
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes

## Current Status:
- âœ… **Session 3 Complete**: Firebase authentication working
- ðŸŽ¯ **Ready for Session 4**: Multiple archers per bale (CORE FUNCTIONALITY)
- ðŸš€ **Server Running**: http://localhost:3000

## Recent Fixes:
- âœ… **Phone Authentication**: Fixed reCAPTCHA initialization and error handling
- âœ… **Score Persistence**: Scores now save to Firestore and persist between ends
- âœ… **Auto-save**: Scores automatically save after each change
- âœ… **Competition Tracking**: Added total competition score display
- âœ… **Color Coding**: Fixed to match exact archery color scheme

## Notes:
- Firebase configuration updated with real project values
- Tailwind CSS v3 installed and working
- Authentication UI ready for testing
- **Need to enable phone authentication in Firebase Console**
- **MULTIPLE ARCHERS PER BALE IS THE CORE FUNCTIONALITY** - not just a feature!
- Current app only supports single archer - needs major redesign for multi-archer support

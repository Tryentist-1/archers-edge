## Quick Start Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
git status           # Check current status
git add .           # Stage all changes
git commit -m "message"  # Commit changes
git push origin archers-edge-dev  # Push to remote
```

### Session Management
```bash
# Start new session
echo "## Session X: [Title]" >> TODO.md

## Reference Materials

### Existing App Structure (reference-app/)
- `js/common.js` - Core scoring utilities
- `js/solo_round.js` - Olympic round scoring logic
- `js/ranking_round.js` - Ranking round implementation
- `css/` - Existing styling patterns

### Key Functions to Migrate
- `parseScoreValue()` - Score parsing logic
- `getScoreColor()` - Visual score feedback
- `calculateAllScores()` - Olympic round calculations
- `saveDataToLocalStorage()` - Data persistence
- `loadDataFromLocalStorage()` - Data retrieval

### Architecture Decisions
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore + Auth + Hosting)
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Offline Support:** Local storage + Firebase sync
- **Mobile First:** Progressive Web App (PWA)

## NOTES

### Login Flow Architecture
The application now supports three authentication modes:
1. **Firebase Authentication**: Full authentication with email/phone
2. **Soft Login**: Profile selection without Firebase auth (for students)
3. **Guest Mode**: Read-only access to public data

### Event Assignment Integration
Event assignments now seamlessly integrate with the scoring system:
- Pre-registration creates bale assignments
- Assignments automatically generate scoring rounds
- HomePage shows "Round in Progress" for active assignments
- Students can immediately start scoring without additional setup

### Firebase Permissions Strategy
- **Public Read**: Profiles collection allows guest access
- **Authenticated Write**: All write operations require authentication
- **Offline Support**: localStorage provides fallback for disconnected users
- **Data Sync**: Firebase data automatically cached locally for soft login users
